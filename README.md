True Order UML
True Order UML is a project aimed at designing an architecture for a hypothetical airline. The project aims to provide an overview of the systems and components involved in the traveller´s experience, including the different market solutions used to deliver services to customers.

Overview:
True Order is an architectural sketch that offers services such as flight booking, hotel reservations, car rentals, and vacation packages. The aim of this project is to design an architecture that can support these services and ensure a seamless experience for customers.

The architecture is divided into different systems such as the Offer Management System, Order Management System, Flight and Schedule Data System, Revenue Accounting System, Third-Party Delivery Systems, Automated Check-in Service, Middleware, Payment Hub, and ESP Reservation Service. These systems are interconnected, and each plays a specific role in ensuring the smooth delivery of services.

In addition to the architecture, the project also includes an activity-based cost estimate that provides an overview of the costs associated with running the online travel agency. The cost estimates are based on the different systems and components involved in the architecture and provide an estimate of the yearly cost of running the True Order platform.

How to use
The True Order UML project includes a Python script that generates a UML diagram based on the architecture described in the project. The script also generates an HTML file that includes the UML diagram, along with additional information about the project.

To use the project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can run the script by navigating to the project directory and running the following command:
    
    python main.py

The script will generate a UML diagram in PNG format, along with an HTML file that includes the diagram and additional project information.
