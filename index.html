The proposed solution will streamline operations, improve customer experience, enhance revenue, and optimize costs. The recommendations also include the type of contract with providers to ensure maximum flexibility and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Problem Statement:</p><p>The current airline retailing systems are fragmented, consisting of multiple legacy systems that are complex, inefficient, and difficult to maintain. The lack of a unified architecture results in operational inefficiencies, limited data sharing, and a suboptimal customer experience. The airline industry needs a solution that consolidates these systems into a cohesive architecture that supports efficient and effective retailing operations.</p><p>Proposed Solution:</p><p>The proposed solution involves implementing best market solutions for each component of the retailing architecture, coupled with a unifying architecture to consolidate operations. Key components include Offer Management, Order Management, Revenue Accounting, Third-Party Delivery Systems, Automated Check-in Service (DCS), Middleware, Payment Hub, Flight and Schedule Data System, and ESP Reservation Service.</p><p>Market Solutions:</p><ul><li>Offer Management: Amadeus Altéa Inventory or Sabre AirVision Marketing &amp; Planning Suite</li><li>Order Management: IBS Software iFly Res or Radixx Res</li><li>Revenue Accounting: Accelya REVERA or Mercator Sirius</li><li>Third-Party Delivery Systems: Farelogix FLX Merchandise or Datalex Digital Commerce Platform</li><li>Automated Check-in Service (DCS): Amadeus Altea DCS or SabreSonic DCS</li><li>Middleware: MuleSoft Anypoint Platform or TIBCO Cloud Integration</li><li>Payment Hub: Adyen Payment Platform or Worldpay from FIS</li><li>Flight and Schedule Data System: OAG Schedules Analyzer or Innovata Schedule Reference Service</li><li>ESP Reservation Service: Navitaire New Skies or SITA Horizon</li></ul><p>Unifying Architecture: Implement a microservices-based architecture hosted on AWS, taking advantage of AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3. This will provide scalability, flexibility, and cost optimization.</p><p>Contract Recommendations:</p><ol><li>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) contracts: Choose SaaS solutions wherever possible to reduce upfront costs, simplify maintenance, and ensure scalability.</li><li>Pay-per-use pricing: Opt for contracts with pay-per-use pricing models to align costs with actual usage and avoid overpaying during low-demand periods.</li><li>Long-term agreements with volume discounts: Negotiate long-term agreements with providers that offer volume discounts, ensuring better pricing as the business grows.</li><li>Flexible termination clauses: Include termination clauses that allow for flexibility in case of a need to switch providers or renegotiate terms based on changing business requirements.</li></ol><p>Benefits:</p><ol><li>Improved customer experience: A unified architecture provides a seamless customer journey, with personalized offers, simplified booking, and efficient check-in processes.</li><li>Increased revenue potential: Enhanced retailing capabilities allow for better targeting, dynamic pricing, and the ability to upsell ancillary services, driving revenue growth.</li><li>Operational efficiency: Streamlined processes and systems reduce manual work, save time, and minimize errors.</li><li>Cost optimization: Consolidating systems and leveraging cloud services lower both capital and operational expenses.</li></ol><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The proposed solution of implementing best market solutions and a unifying architecture for airline retailing will address the current challenges faced by the industry. By streamlining operations, enhancing the customer experience, and optimizing costs, airlines will be better positioned to compete in the market and drive growth. It's recommended that airlines adopt the suggested solutions and contract types to maximize the benefits and ensure a successful implementation.</p><p>Conducting a thorough cost analysis requires considering various factors and components of the proposed airline retailing solution.
